Libraries and software to install
*************************************

Best solution is to download OMDev:
https://openmodelica.org/svn/OpenModelicaExternal/trunk/tools/windows/OMDev
then read INSTALL.txt in the OMDev directory
It will provide you *all* the needed libraries and tools

- Install OpenModelica
	https://openmodelica.org/download/download-windows
	or compile it from scratch
	https://github.com/OpenModelica/


Define the environment
*************************
GIT clone OpenModelica from:
https://github.com/OpenModelica/
to path/to/OpenModelica
Set OpenModelica home:
OPENMODELICAHOME e.g. path/to/OpenModelica/build

Compilation using qmake
********************
Start:
- OMDev\tools\msys\mingw64_shell.bat for 64bit compilation
- OMDev\tools\msys\mingw64_shell.bat for 32bit compilation

> cd path/to/OpenModelica
> make -f Makefile.omdev.mingw -j8 omoptim

You can also compile with QtCreator from OMDev
by opening the OpenModelica/OMOptim/OMOptim/build/OMOptim.pro


Dymola
*******
To use Dymola as simulator, be sure to set Dymola executable path in Settings panel (in ModOpt interface itself)

Execution
**********
To be launched, OMOptim.exe needs in its folder some dlls (add letter 'd' at the end for debug version).
These libraries can be found in OpenModelica\build\bin\ folder.
- Qt*.dll
- omni*.dll
- Qwt5.dll library
- libgcc_s*.dll
- libstdc++*.dll
- ming*.dll


Class Documentation
********************
A class documentation is available (while incomplete). It should be built using doxygen. File to compile with doxygen is Doc/Doxyfile
